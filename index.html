    <p style="font-weight: bold;">In our daily lives, we encounter news and events that often lack joy. Comedy serves
        as a respite during stressful times, allowing us to take a break and lift our spirits. By boosting our
        moods, comedy contributes to an overall better quality of life.
        Also, Comedy can be a powerful tool for solving or avoiding conflicts. When faced with
        disagreements, using humor can help defuse tension and make problem-solving more effective. It allows us to
        address issues in a lighthearted manner, leading to quicker resolution.
        Even in serious situations, comedy can play a role. After an argument with a
        partner, watching a funny movie together or spending time with friends can provide much-needed comedic
        relief. However, it is essential to strike a balance and not avoid conflict altogether.
        Laughter is not just fun; it also has positive effects on our physical health.
        Comedy helps maintain blood pressure, reduces stress, and improves blood flow. Regularly watching funny
        movies or TV shows can even contribute to preventing heart attacks.
        Exposure to humor stimulates the brain to produce dopamine, the “happiness hormone.”
        Engaging with comedy activates cognitive functions like focus and creativity. Additionally, positive humor
        acts as a protective factor against anxiety and depression.
        Social Bonding: Shared laughter creates bonds between people. Being funny makes individuals more attractive,
        and studies show that women appreciate men who enjoy watching funny movies or using comedy.</p>
